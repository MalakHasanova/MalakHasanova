Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Malak !
I am full-stack Software Developer / Product Manager with an information management background, I bring a unique perspective and excellent attention to detail to my work. With over 12 years of experience managing information management systems, training stakeholders and clients for organizations such as the Sir Robert McAlpineâ€™s, Morgan Sindall, Hill International and BP, I have developed my skills in project management, storytelling, and delivering high-quality results under pressure.
Recently, I completed Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp, where I gained practical experience in web development technologies including Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Data Science. I am now seeking to bring my technical and creative expertise and entrepreneurial and innovational approach to a new career in the tech industry.
My ability to communicate complex ideas and work collaboratively with diverse teams is one of my strengths. I am passionate about using my skills to build impactful, user-focused products that deliver value to businesses and users alike. With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a natural curiosity, I am excited to take on new challenges as a full-stack software developer / product manager or other tech related roles.
